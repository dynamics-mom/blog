It‚Äôs quite difficult to write a blog with 2 y.o., but more difficult is to do this when you are sick yourself.  After weeks of getting better, I finally find the time to write some words about Business Central. When I have started my blog, all people tell me I must create new article on regular basis. It is difficult I can agree‚Ä¶ after the work you only dream about the bad and some sleep instead of sitting next to the table and write. After weeks of sickness, I have finally put myself together and create some manual about Intercompany. Hope you will like it!
At first create the IC company in the system. You can create one from the beginning or use the one of the existing companies as a template. 
Go to Companies -> New or Copy

It can take a while‚Ä¶

Then do the Mapping between the Chart of Accounts. We must remember that sales transactions in one company will the purchase for another. That mean on one side there will be a revenue and on the other side it will be a cost. Go to Intercompany Chart of Accounts

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118689671/220185803-dc8d1d34-45cd-4774-823d-f277961d8109.png)

There is possibility to use the existing CoA by Home -> Copy from Chart of Account. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118689671/220185826-09bec8b1-118e-4084-b948-5ce4716d1161.png)

Then do the mapping in the Map-to G/L Acc. No.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118689671/220185850-a72a5db2-f584-488d-915e-304ba615b546.png)

If some of the accounts should be populated as the same, you can use the function Home -> Map to Acc. With Same No. (it can be done for multiple account by Select more function on the line). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118689671/220185879-c1883957-a19c-40ab-9ea2-fbdacd181757.png)

If any of the accounts shouldn‚Äôt be used it can be Blocked.

The setup can be also Import/Export between the IC companies.

Then do the mapping between the dimensions. Go to Tell me -> Intercompany Dimensions

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118689671/220185978-8785f1ce-ec4c-4e04-8fa2-146daf7fd279.png)

Similarly, to CoA the Dimensions can be copy from company setup. Go to Dimension -> Copy from Dimensions. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118689671/220186020-9450ff7c-c73b-4ab9-95bb-52a004c7f667.png)

Then do the mapping manually or map the same. To copy the mapping go to Dimensions -> Map to Dim. with Same Code. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118689671/220186051-03ff062f-4572-4227-83f7-45aec2e40748.png)

The Dimension Values was copied as well so you must adjust them if necessary.

Note: Intercompany Purchase Transactions are not handled Resources, Fixed Assets, Item Charges. If you have one of this type it will be send blank, so the user needs to adjust it later. 

Then create the Intercompany Vendor and Customer.
