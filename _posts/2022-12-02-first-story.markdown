That will be a story why I have decided to start a blog. The second part of the story gives the conclusion on why a proper development task description provided by the consultant matters. I have collected the tips and suggestions from my developer’s friends to help other write proper documentation. 
It was a lovely evening until the little one (my son, Franek) woke up with 38 degrees. It was 10 PM, so I knew that finding a nanny for the next day will be impossible! 2 hours earlier I finished the general concepts of the development task for the training for junior developers the next day. I did it as general as possible because I knew I will be at the meeting with them to answer the questions. We made a deal with a daddy that he will cover the first part of the day so I will attend to the workshop. Then I will be back and cover the second part of the day. On my way to the office, I was talking to a friend who was running the training (that’s coincidence that he is my neighbor). The first thing when I came to the office, I informed my colleagues that I need to run to home in the middle of the day. In this kind of situations, I always feel so unprofessional knowing that I should be in the office, but I simply can’t… but then I realized people understand this. I’m not the only one whose kid is sick on an important day (or the first day of holidays :)). 

Dear ladies - don’t worry, these situations happen all the time. Just do the rest of your job the best you can, and people will fully support you. I think the pandemic period changed minds of a lot of people. 

Recently, I had a situation that my sick child didn’t want to go for a nap with nanny. I took him on my hands and started swinging but I was on the familiarization meeting with another team. Suddenly my manager said that now Magda will introduce herself, but please switch the camera on. First thing that came to my mind – “oh no”. I did it as he said, but in the beginning, I said that I’m a mother and then I started talking about myself. Nobody reacted, everyone was super chilled about the whole situation. It doesn’t mean that now I will go with Franek for all my meetings, but I want to say that such stories happen, and we shouldn’t cry about it. 

Let’s go back to story. During our way to the office, we have discussed that I would like to do something more to create my own consultant brand. The friend of my suggested the blog, so my first answer was… yeah with Franek I can write about mother’s live mostly. That’s how the Dynamics Mom was created. As a kid I wanted to be a journalist (the sports one, but let’s do some compromises). In the middle of the day, I took taxi back home and, on that way, I have written my first post! Action = reaction! 

What about the workshop and development task description? Why this topic is so important? Nowadays we mostly work from home, cooperating with people across the word, different time zones, different mother language. The time when we were at the office every day and we could discuss face to face all programming changes have passed. The proper description of task was important as well to keep the history of the features. Now we must write it properly because sometimes we are not online all the time. We walk our dog during the day, make doctor appointments, dentists, some of us like to start work at 12 AM. and some at 7 AM. (crazy ones). 

The consultant job (sometimes even considered a business analyst) is to take all the requirements from the client and put it as a story to the developers. Once during the interview, the headhunter asked me what the consultant work is. I like to say that we are kind of translators, we talk with the clients using financial and functional language and translate it into developer’s language to create the features. As I mentioned already, we can’t always join the call, ask additional questions, and wait for the answers - so to do not stop the and try to describe the requirement as good as in possible from the beginning (even if it means redoing some of the work you already did or spending another hour on analysis).
