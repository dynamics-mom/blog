New Year, new blog post! I wanted to write a new post from a while, but it was the first time when I was sick and not the little one. It was quite a lesson, because now I know what is more difficult than watching kid when is ill. Watching the kid when you are sick but and he is healthy üòä Trust me, there is no time for new blogs or new Business Central changes.  

I want to say some words after a Christmas party time. One of my friends called me after her work meeting with a sad story. During the party one of the managers said that he must lower the recruitment standards because organization ordered him to hire more women. I wasn‚Äôt there so I cannot say if in his opinion women are less smart or less qualified for the job. Maybe he should think what the organization should do encourage them to apply for the position. Why there are still people who think that IT is too ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù for women. I‚Äôve been working in this environment for a long time, and I met a lot of organized, qualified, experienced women who were recruited with the same standards as men. As a woman and as a mother I feel that there are lot of valuable women, but they are afraid of changes. They need more stabilization, cooperation with the company they work for. In my opinion if they are not applying, then that is the reason of not so high standards. 
I wanted to say more positive words in my blog, but I cannot skip this topic. Let‚Äôs search some good news. Starting from the Oct 1st you can use Tell me to also search by the document lines, not only headers. The function is available on the posted and non-posted documents. See the list below:

The list can be simple filtered by Document Type and e.g. Quantity to Invoice. We can recognize which lines on all the Orders are received but not invoiced.
