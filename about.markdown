My name is Magdalena Rutkowska, but all my friends and co-workers call me Magda. I’m a mother of a little devil called Franek, fiancé of Business Central Developer and Senior Business Central Finance Consultant. 

I have started my professional career when I was 19. My fist job in accounting, gave me an inspiration to study Finance and Accounting. In my second year of my bachelor degree I decided to apply for an international internship. That’s how I landed in Bologna one day where I spent 3 super, nice months doing audits in Mazars. One year later I decided to go back to Bologna for Master Degree at Quantitative Finance at University of Bologna. I gave up this after 4 month because it wasn’t completely for me. I received there lesson of live abroad, fluency in language and self-esteem that I can do better! One day when I was working in my 3rd accounting job, my boss proposed me to become the Navision consultant. I’m glad for that to this day! I hated being an accountant :) 

The day when I became a consultant I was born again profesionally. It wasn’t simple and years later my co-workers confirmed that not a lot of them believed I will do it. I knew the system, but then they talked to me in a foreign language of IT (tables, pages, xmlports, etc.). I have never stopped believing in myself and now I’m a consultant with 6 years of experience in Polish and international projects. In 2021 I became a mother. My live turned upside down, even more after I have came back to work. Am I a good consultant? It isn’t a question for me but for my co-workers and clients. Am I a good mother? Ask my son or read my blog to check yourself the answers for both questions. I have decided to start this blog to tell people how I work in 2 shifts, give some courage to other women and of course to provide my personal experience about newest features in Business Central.
